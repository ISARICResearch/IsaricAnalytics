# IsaricAnalytics

IsaricAnalytics is a data analysis toolkit to support fast analysis of clinical data during
emerging infectious disease outbreaks. It supports medical statistics and traditional
machine learning, with analysis pipelines that follow methodological best practices.

IsaricAnalytics assumes a flexible [data schema](https://github.com/IsaricResearch/IsaricAnalytics/schema)
based on ISARIC's tools for data collection, [ARC](https://github.com/IsaricResarch/ARC)
and [BRIDGE](https://github.com/IsaricResarch/BRIDGE), but is general enough for other
data sources if the data is transformed to the same structure.

ISARIC encourages data collection using standardised variable names, definitions, answer
options, codelists, and more. In addition, the purpose of data collected using ISARIC
tools is for clinical characterisation during outbreaks. This means that the data share
characteristics that allow some automation during research analyses and the re-use of
elements of analysis pipelines to similar contexts. This package is designed to support
Reusable Analytical Pipelines for Infectious Diseases (RAPIDs), which is based on the concept
of [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/).
